### Exercises for Intro to Parallel Computing Workshop on UIUC's ICC
The last version of this workshop was on 2023-04-13.
This workshop is offered by the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/).
Each exercise is comprised of a serial code and the OpenMP-parallelized version of it. Makefiles are available for compilation with GCC, as well as batch job scripts with specific configurations to run the code on different systems.

## 1. [hello](https://github.com/babreu-ncsa/IntroToPC/tree/main/hello)
This exercise is the classic *Hello, World!* code. It serves as an introduction to how threads can execute tasks independently and asynchronously. 


## 2. [stats](https://github.com/babreu-ncsa/IntroToPC/tree/main/stats)
The *STATS* application calculates simples statistical problems of a large collection of real numbers extracted from a uniform probability distribution and organized into an array. It serves as an introduction to the concept of Task Parallelism.


## 3. [saxpy](https://github.com/babreu-ncsa/IntroToPC/tree/main/saxpy)
The *SAXPY* application performs a very common operation in Linear Algebra-related packages. It serves as an introduction to the concept of Data Parallelism.
